`slice()` and `filter()` 

---

`select` is used to select certain variables in the data frame. 


.left-panel[
```{r}
select(lapd, year, base_pay)
```
]

--

.right-panel[

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  select(year, base_pay)
```

]

---

`select` can also be used to drop certain variables if used with a negative sign.

```{r}
select(lapd, -row_id, -department_title)
```

---

## Selection helpers

`starts_with()`  
`ends_with()`  
`contains()`  

---

```{r}
select(lapd, starts_with("q"))
```

---

```{r}
select(lapd, ends_with("pay"))
```

---

```{r}
select(lapd, contains("pay"))
```

```

`slice()` and `filter()` 

---

.pull-left[
`slice()` subsetting rows based on a row number.

The data below include all the rows from third to seventh. Including third and seventh.

```{r}
slice(lapd, 3:7)
```


]

--

.pull-right[

`filter()` subsetting rows based on a condition.

The data below includes rows when the recorded year is 2018.

```{r}
filter(lapd, year == 2018)
```

]

Q. According to [datausa.io](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/los-angeles-ca#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20CA,%2462%2C474%2C%20a%203.78%25%20increase.) Los Angeles had a median household income of $62474 in 2018. How many LAPD staff members had a base pay higher than $62474 in year 2018 according to this data?

.footnote[Median household income is **not** the same thing as median employee income. Our aim is data wrangling and not necessarily statistical analysis for now.]

---

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(year == 2018 & base_pay > 62474)
```


---


```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(year == 2018 & base_pay > 62474) %>% 
  nrow()
```

---

Q. How many observations are available between 2013 and 2015 including 2013 and 2015?

--

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(year >= 2013 & year <= 2015)
```

---

Q. How many observations are available between 2013 and 2015 including 2013 and 2015?



```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(year >= 2013 & year <= 2015) %>% 
  nrow()
```

---

Q. How many LAPD staff were employed full time in 2018?



```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(employment_type == "Full Time" & year == 2018) %>% 
  nrow()
```

---

We have done all sorts of selections, slicing, filtering on `lapd` but it has not changed at all. Why do you think so?

```{r}
glimpse(lapd)
```

---

Moving forward we are only going to focus on year 2018, and use `job_class_title`, `employment_type`, and `base_pay`. Let's clean our data accordingly and move on with the smaller `lapd` data that we need.

---

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  filter(year == 2018) %>% 
  select(job_class_title, 
         employment_type, 
         base_pay)
```

---

```{r}
lapd <- 
  lapd %>% 
  filter(year == 2018) %>% 
  select(job_class_title, 
         employment_type, 
         base_pay)
```

**Problem with writing functions within functions**

Things will get messy and more difficult to read and debug as we deal with more complex operations on data.

The output of the first function is the first argument of the second function.

Do you recall composite functions such as $f \circ g(x)$?

Now we have $f \circ g \circ h (x)$ or `round(mean(c(4, 8, 16)))`

```{r eval = FALSE}

  g() %>%

```{r eval = FALSE}

  mean() %>% 
  round()

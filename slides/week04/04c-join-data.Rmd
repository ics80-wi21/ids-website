## Join Functions

`something_join(x, y)` All the join functions in dplyr package are in this fashion where x represents the first data frame and y represents the second data frame.



---

.panelset[
.panel[

.panel-name[x]

```{r}
songs
```


]

.panel[

.panel-name[y]

```{r}
albums
```


]

.panel[

.panel-name[left_join()]

```{r}
left_join(songs, albums, by = "album_name")
```

]

]

`left_join()` includes all rows from x



---

.panel[

.panel-name[y]

```{r}
albums
```


]

.panel[

.panel-name[right_join()]

```{r}
right_join(songs, albums, by = "album_name")
```

]

]

`right_join()` includes all rows from `y`
